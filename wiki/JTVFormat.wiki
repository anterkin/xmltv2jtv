JTV requires 2 separate files for each channel: 
 # *.pdt* - contains program names.
 # *.ndx* - contains program schedule.

1. *.pdt* file always starts with string "*JTV 3.x TV Program Data*" followed by 3 bytes with hex values *A0*. Then goes 2 bytes program name length and program name itself (encoding is unknown, for Cyrillic win-1251 is used)

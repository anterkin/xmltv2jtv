#summary Windows time format (time stamp)
#labels Featured

= Description =

 Windows time is stored in FILETIME structure:
{{{
typedef struct _FILETIME {
  DWORD dwLowDateTime;
  DWORD dwHighDateTime;
} FILETIME; 
}}}

Note: *JTV format uses endian different from Java*

= Details =

 Java timestamps use 64-bit milliseconds since 1970 GMT. Windows timestamps use 64-bit value representing the number of 100-nanosecond intervals since January 1, 1601, with ten thousand times as much precision.
{{{
private static final long DIFF_IN_MILLIS = 11644473600000L;
}}}

 DIFF_IN_MILLIS is the difference between January 1 1601 and January 1 1970 in milliseconds. Done according to Gregorian Calendar, no correction for 1752-09-02 Wednesday was followed immediately by 1752-09-14 Thursday dropping 12 days. Also according to [http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/java-patches/2003-q1/msg00565.html].

 Conversion between Java and Windows times:
{{{
public static long getJavaTime(longwindowsTime)
{
   return (windowsTime / 10000) - DIFF_IN_MILLIS;
}

public static long getWindowsTime(longjavaTime)
{
   return (javaTime + DIFF_IN_MILLIS) * 10000;
}
}}}

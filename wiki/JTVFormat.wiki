#labels Featured,Phase-Implementation

= Description =

JTV requires 2 separate files for each channel: 
 # *.pdt* - contains program names.
 # *.ndx* - contains program schedule.

1. *.pdt* file always starts with string "*JTV 3.x TV Program Data*" followed by 3 bytes with hex values *A0h*. Then goes 2 byte program name length and program name itself (encoding is unknown, for Cyrillic win-1251 is used) 

2. *.ndx* file starts with 2 byte number (count of records) followed by 12 byte records:
   * 2 byte - always *0* value
   * 8 byte - windows [http://code.google.com/p/xmltv2jtv/wiki/WindowsTime FILETIME] structure, actually 64bit integer representing windows time in milliseconds - program start time.
   * 2 byte - offset in *.pdt* file to find program name.


Note: *JTV format uses little endian while Java uses network byte order - big endian*
